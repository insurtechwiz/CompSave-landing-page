                <h3>Problem 1: Insured’s loyalty isn’t synonymous with rate decreases</h3>
                <p>Many businesses do not want to change brokers because of the high migration efforts required to change and fear of being stuck with someone they aren’t familiar with. Often, a client’s loyalty makes the broker complacent, neglecting to send out a submission to the most competitive carriers each year. It’s safer to deal with the familiar. Loyalty is not always rewarded.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Problem 2: Shopping for insurance is confusing</h3>
                <p>Not a way to view submission progress. Gap of information. Brokers go unchecked, and take advantage. Brokers make money on a percentage of premium sold. No good reason for brokers to reduce cost. Lower rates equate to lower commissions. Brokers are not always right. They may not have selected to best fit carriers for your business. Why would they help you find a better rate if they know that you will stay?</p>
